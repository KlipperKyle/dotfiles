Miscellaneous personal config files.

Often times, I link people to various under here.  Use at your own
risk.  If something is helpful, then great!  Feel free to use it.  If
something breaks your system, well sorry.

Wow!  There is a lot of history here.  This repository has survived my
journey through my college years and a full-time engineering job at a
large tech company.  The various configuration files and hacks span
